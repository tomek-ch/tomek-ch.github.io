My name is Tomasz Chmielnicki, but you can call me Tomek.

I like programming because solving problems and building things is fun. I place an emphasis on user experience and code maintainability.

I like working with people, which is why I occasionally coach aspiring developers. Besides programming, I enjoy design and [writing](/blog).
