When we start learning programming, everything is new. We have to learn the syntax, understand the language of our choice, and practice problem solving.

We're not focused on writing the most efficient solution, or architecting a maintainable system. Our goal is simply to get the thing to work.

Instead of thinking about reusability, encapsulation and other such principles, we're trying to figure out why the code isn't working, and how to fix it.

To fix our program, we need to test the assumptions we make about it. Is every variable what we expect it to be? Did we actually call the function?

We need to trace the logic of our code to understand what went wrong and figure out how to fix it.

As we gain more experience, we understand the code we write more. We become better at quickly spotting and fixing bugs. Because of this, we can focus more on creating maintainable code instead of just trying to get a working solution. As a result, it becomes even easier for us to fix errors in our programs.

Then we get assigned to a legacy codebase, developed over the years by many people with different levels of experience, using now outdated technologies, employing questionable practices.

We get to work on our first, seemingly simple task. We write the solution, but it doesn't work. Why doesn't it work? It should work.

After some debugging, we find out that it's because another part of the system was interfering with what we wrote. We look at that code thinking "who in the world would write this?".

We quickly realise that the codebase is a global mess of spaghetti code and getting anything done will be difficult. Instead of developing the system, we spend our time wrestling with its complexity, getting angry, and demotivated.

We're constantly frustrated when working on the project, and rightfully so. So what should we do?

While rewriting the entire thing from scratch using new tech, and sticking to good practices would probably improve the situation, it's not an option, because of how much time it would take.

We could switch to a different project, but we're thinking "I'm not a quitter, I can do this". So how should we approach working with a codebase like that?

We need to go back to where we started. Instead of becoming frustrated because our code isn't working as expected, we need to diligently test our assumptions about it. That's how we find out why the program is broken, and how to fix it.

Instead of feeling resentful because of the bad practices in the codebase, we need to accept it for what it is. We need to let go of our emotions, be objective, and focus on the present. We need to be mindful.

Everything in our programs happens for a reason, and our job is to find that reason.

It's a tedious, time-consuming, and exhausting process.

After all the hard work, when we finally manage to find and fix the bug, we might feel a spark of joy. The same joy that we felt when we were learning to code. Getting lost and figuring out our way to the solution. Testing every assumption, closely following the logic of our code. Feeling like a beginner again.
